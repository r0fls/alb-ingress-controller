# Configuration

This document covers configuration of the ALB Ingress Controller.

## AWS API Access

To perform operations, the controller must have required IAM role capabilities for accessing and
provisioning ALB resources. There are many ways to achieve this, such as loading `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables or using [kube2iam](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam).

A sample IAM policy, with the minimum permissions to run the controller, can be found in [examples/alb-iam-policy.json](../examples/iam-policy.json).

## Setting Ingress Resource Scope

By default, all ingress resources in your cluster are seen by the controller. However, only ingress resources that contain the [required annotations](https://github.com/coreos/alb-ingress-controller/blob/master/docs/ingress-resources.md#required-annotations) will be satisfied by the ALB Ingress Controller.

You can further limit the ingresses your controller has access to. The options available are limiting the ingress class  (`ingress.class`) or limiting the namespace watched (`--watch-namespace=`). Each approach is detailed below.

### Limiting Ingress Class

Setting the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation allows for classification of ingress resources and is especially helpful when running multiple ingress controllers in the same cluster. See [Using Multiple Ingress Controllers](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/master/examples/multiple-ingress-controllers#using-multiple-ingress-controllers) for more details.

An example of the container spec portion of the controller, only listening for resources with the class "alb", would be as follows.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /server
    - --default-backend-service=kube-system/default-http-backend
    - --ingress-class=alb
```

Now, only ingress resources with the appropriate annotation are picked up, as seen below.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: echoserver
  namespace: echoserver
  annotations:
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/port: "8080,9000"
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/subnets: subnet-63bf6318,subnet-0b20aa62
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups: sg-1f84f776
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "alb"
spec:
	...
```

### Limiting Namespaces

Setting the `--watch-namespace` argument constrains the controller's scope to a single namespace. Ingress events outside of the namespace specified are not be seen by the controller. An example of the container spec, for a controller watching only the `default` namespace, is as follows.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /server
    - --default-backend-service=kube-system/default-http-backend
    - --watch-namespace=default
```

> Currently, you can set only 1 namespace to watch in this flag. See [this Kubernetes issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/847) for more details.

### Limiting External Namespaces

Setting the `--restrict-scheme` boolean flag to `true` will enable the ALB controller to check configmap named `alb-ingress-controller-internet-facing-ingresses` for a list of approved ingresses before provisioning ALBs with an internet-facing scheme. Here is an example of that ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
 mynamespace: my-ingress-name
 myothernamespace: my-other-ingress-name
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: alb-ingress-controller-internet-facing-ingresses
```


That ConfigMap is kept in `default` if unspecified, but can moved to another with the `ALB_CONTROLLER_RESTRICT_SCHEME_CONFIG_NAMESPACE` environment variable.
